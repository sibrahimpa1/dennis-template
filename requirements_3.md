* General

  * Navigation between the pages with the large hero images is a bit to harsh
    for us. Can you try and add a fade in to the hero image and then the box and
    then slide in the line?
  * See screenshot of non-fullwidth nav on iOS safari (let me know if I can help
    narrow this down more too)
